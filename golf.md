# Strengths
1. Taking specs and turning them into a fully working app. TDD. Expereinced enough to solve most issues on my own. Low maintenance. Full stack means I can handle the backend code, front-end javascript and design. I'm great at breaking down complex business logic into a tangible database structure and code.

# Weaknesses
1. Sometimes I rely too much on my ability to solve issues when I should ask for help. Deploying to AWS without using Laravel Forge. Writing advanced javascript. WordPress.
